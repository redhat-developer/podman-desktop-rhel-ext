# RHEL VMs Extension

The RHEL VMs extension helps the user run RHEL Virtual machines.

## Pre-requisites

### On Windows/WSL/x86_64

The `macadam` binary is embedded in the extension, nothing needs to be installed.

### On Mac/arm64

When initialized, the extension checks if the necessary binaries are present in `/opt/macadam/bin`. If they are not, the extension installs them in this directory.

> If this installation fails, you can run the installer manually, using the installer found at https://github.com/crc-org/macadam/releases/tag/v0.1.1. After this, you need to restart the extension which should find and use the binaries.

### On Linux/x86_64

The `macadam` binary must be installed in the directory `/opt/macadam/bin/`: download the binary from https://github.com/crc-org/macadam/releases/tag/v0.1.1 and rename it `macadam`.

The `gvproxy` binary must be installed in the directory `/usr/local/libexec/podman/`: download the binary from https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock/releases/tag/v0.8.5 and rename it `gvproxy`.

## Install the extension

OCI Images to install the extensions are available at https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-rhel-ext/pkgs/container/podman-desktop-rhel-ext.
